### Direct downloads for Ubuntu / Debian

Version **0.3.2 / amd64 (x86-64)**:

- [Download the deb package](releases/ubuntu/folimeld_0.3.2_amd64.deb?raw=true) (Ubuntu 22.04 or later / Debian 13)
- [Download the Snap package](releases/ubuntu/folimeld_0.3.2_amd64.snap?raw=true) (requires snapd)
- [SHA-256 checksums](releases/ubuntu/folimeld_0.3.2_SHA256SUMS.txt?raw=true)

Run the installation command for your chosen package from the download folder.

```bash
# deb package
sudo apt install ./folimeld_0.3.2_amd64.deb

# Snap package
sudo snap install --dangerous ./folimeld_0.3.2_amd64.snap
```

Version **0.3.2 / arm64 (AArch64)**:

- [Download the ARM64 deb package](releases/ubuntu/folimeld_0.3.2_arm64.deb?raw=true) (Ubuntu 22.04 or later / Debian 13)
- [Download the ARM64 Snap package](releases/ubuntu/folimeld_0.3.2_arm64.snap?raw=true) (requires snapd)
- [SHA-256 checksums](releases/ubuntu/folimeld_0.3.2_SHA256SUMS.txt?raw=true)

```bash
# ARM64 deb package
sudo apt install ./folimeld_0.3.2_arm64.deb

# ARM64 Snap package
sudo snap install --dangerous ./folimeld_0.3.2_arm64.snap
```

Debian 13 uses the same deb package as Ubuntu. If a minimal installation displays `Fontconfig error: Cannot load default config file`, run `sudo apt install fontconfig-config`. PDF display, page movement, rotation, saving, and reopening have been verified on Debian 13.6 amd64 (WSL2 / WSLg, X11). See the [Debian verification record](docs/debian-wsl-verification.md) (in Japanese) for details. Installation of the deb package and startup with a PDF have also been verified on arm64 (WSL2).

## Basic usage

Open **Help → User guide** or press F1 to view basic operations, settings, and keyboard shortcuts. You can keep the guide open while working on a PDF.

1. Launch Folimeld and select a PDF using **File → Open**.
2. Click a page to select it. Use Ctrl or Shift to select multiple pages.
3. Edit pages using the toolbar, menus, or drag and drop.
4. Export the PDF using **Save** or **Save As**.

Opening a password-protected PDF displays a prompt for the password required to open it.

### Document settings

The **Details** tab in **Document Properties** lets you change the PDF version and page layout. Selecting `TwoPageLeft` or `TwoPageRight` raises the PDF version to 1.5 if necessary.

### Saved preferences

Under **Settings → Image Size**, choose a thumbnail size of 144, 288, or 432 px for the longer edge (default: 288 px). Changes take effect immediately.

The display language, image size, and last opened folder are saved on your device. PDFs are processed locally. Support purchases in the Windows MSIX edition use Microsoft Store to retrieve product information, check purchase status, and process payments. PDFs are never sent to the Store.

In the Windows MSIX edition, **Help → Support Development…** lets you make a one-time purchase with a supporter icon (once the product is published in the Store). Purchasing adds a supporter icon to the Help menu. PDF editing features are the same whether or not you make a purchase. For developer setup instructions, see [Windows support purchases](docs/windows-store-purchases.md) (in Japanese).
